    """
    Abstract base class for dynamic mixing algorithms.

    This class defines the interface for dynamic mixing algorithms and provides support for accumulating
    losses and counts across training steps, even when the number of domains (or mixture components)
    changes over time.

    Subclasses should implement the `calc_mixture` method, which computes the updated mixture
    coefficients based on the accumulated losses and counts.
